                The goal of this project is to assess the impact of COVID-19 globally, with a specific focus on
                Portugal, and to investigate the role of vaccination in reducing COVID-19 deaths.
                To achieve this goal, the project will analyze data on COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide, and in
                Portugal specifically, over time. The project will also analyze data on vaccination rates in Portugal
                and investigate the relationship between vaccination and COVID-19 deaths.

            <ol>
                <li class="spacedItem">
                    The global impact of COVID-19 has been substantial, with 669,111,131 confirmed cases and 6,842,436
                    fatalities reported worldwide. This pandemic has significantly affected various aspects of life,
                    including healthcare systems, economies, education, and social interactions.
                    One of the ways we can visualize the global impact of COVID-19 is through the map charts in the
                    report. These demonstrate that countries with the highest number of confirmed cases are not
                    necessarily the ones with the highest number of deaths. The variations may be due to several
                    factors, such as differences in healthcare systems, population demographics, and government
                    responses.
                </li>
                <li class="spacedItem">
                    Portugal has been significantly impacted by COVID-19, with 54,207 confirmed cases reported for every
                    100,000 inhabitants. However, the fatality rate per 100,000 cases is comparatively low, with only
                    469 deaths reported.
                    While the number of cases reported in Portugal is concerning, it is essential to note that the
                    fatality rate may be influenced by several factors, such as the country's healthcare system, age
                    demographics, and government response. Nonetheless, the Portuguese government has implemented
                    several measures to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, including vaccination campaigns, social
                    distancing protocols, and the mandatory use of masks in public spaces.
                    We can confirm that there were two peaks in COVID-19 cases: one after the holiday season of 2020, as
                    families gathered together, and another in 2022, when measures to prevent the spread of the virus
                    were reduced. It's likely that the number of cases began to increase at a slower rate because
                    testing has decreased since the summer of 2022.
                </li>
                <li class="spacedItem">
                    Portugal has surpassed the global average in terms of COVID-19 vaccine administration, with an
                    impressive rate of 95,228 out of every 100,000 people vaccinated, compared to the global average of
                    only 10,478 out of every 100,000 people. It is worth noting that global values are calculated based
                    only on countries for which there is available data.

                    Moreover, the total number of COVID-19 vaccines administered in Portugal is 28,106,464, covering
                    9,779,388 individuals. This suggests that, on average, each person has received about three vaccine
                    doses.
                </li>
                <li class="spacedItem">
                    The data presented in the report charts suggests that as the number of vaccinated individuals
                    increases, the curve on the death charts slows down. This observation may indicate that the
                    vaccination campaign in Portugal has been successful in reducing the impact of COVID-19 on the
                    population.

                    However, it is important to note that there may be other factors at play, such as changes in
                    government policies or improvements in healthcare systems.

                            or did not have data. Removing these rows will ensure that the data we analyse is

                            table: “total_cases,” “new_cases,” “total_deaths,” and “new_deaths”. By removing rows
                            with null values, we will have a dataset with only significant values, allowing us to
